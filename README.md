# COGS 118A FINAL PROJECT
This is the source code and report to my final project for COGS 118A - Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms at UCSD

This report investigates the comparative performance of supervised machine learning algorithms across multiple diverse datasets, focusing on their effectiveness and reliability. Through empirical analysis, the study evaluates algorithm performance, specifically Random Forests, SVM, and Neural Networks, across varying training partitions and hyperparameter configurations. The results confirm prior findings that Random Forests consistently achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios. This research emphasizes the importance of leveraging varied datasets and a broad range of models to ensure comprehensive and robust evaluations.
